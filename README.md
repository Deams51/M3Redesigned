# UltracortexM3

EEG Headset project

Following the same process as for the [Ultracortex Mark3](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ultracortex/tree/master/Mark_3), a 3D scan of a head was used to place the electrode location and then joints were derived. 
This frame is compatible with the rest of the component of the M3 (electrode holder...).
As for now, there is no attachment for the case of the OpenBCI board.
